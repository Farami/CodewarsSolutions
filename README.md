To run the tests you have to install karma, jasmine-core and karma-babel-preprocessor.

To do so, enter the following:
```
  npm install -g karma
  npm install -g jasmine-core
```

You can then run the tests for each solution by running the following command inside every folder
```
  karma start karma.conf.js
```
